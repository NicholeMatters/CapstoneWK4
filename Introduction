Problem: The Italian food industry produces 58 billion dollars in the United States annually.  In this project, I will explore the best dining options for an Italian restaurant throughout the city of New York.  New York is a major metropolitan area with over 8.4 million residences (Quick Facts, 2018). There are over 700,000 Manhattan residents who identify as having Italian ancestry, so there is a high demand for more quality Italian food.  This report explores which neighborhoods and boroughs of New York City have the most as well as the best Italian restaurants.

Audience: My target audience will be new residence in New York and those looking for new restaurantsâ€™ locations.
